# School_District_Analysis
### Using pandas, python, anaconda

## Purpose/Overview
This analysis was done for a school board that noticed some academic dishonesty from one of the schools in the initial report. The scores needed to be replaced to make the data more accurate, which can be seen below throughout the analysis. This code refractoring also helps make this analysis more efficient and allows for us to keep creating DataFrames for what we need to analyze further.  


### Results
- Overall, it helps that the school district data is fixed now with the NaN function, which can be seen in the image below.  This doesn't cause a lot of change overall, however, since the data frame is looking at all schools, scores, and spending parameters.  The falsified data at Thomas High School caused their overall scores to slightly decrease, which just provides the school district with the most accurate data.  

- The school summary is affected much more, however, especially when diving into the statistics at Thomas High School. This correction shows that the averages and scores decreased after the fix in data.  This is important for staff to know what needs to be changed and where they sit in comparison to other schools.  

- After updating the school district analysis, there were a lot of different changes that could be seen in terms of grades and scores by certain types of sorting data. These can be seen in the categories below. 

### Math and reading scores by grade

As seen in these images, there is a drop in scores at Thomas High School after the data is corrected.  This means they have a lot of improvements to make.

## Summary
1. The change in NaN data to the ninth graders at Thomas High School caused them to decline in overall math and reading performance.
2. Once the data was replaced later on for the 10-12th graders though, grades went up at Thomas High School which put them into the High Performing Category. 
3. Thomas High School has a very high % of students passing reading and math (90%). It was at 65 before the change. 
4. Thomas High School performs very well for the spending range that it is in. It does well due to the charter status as well, which can both be seen on the scores by school type and size images above.  

All in all, this analysis provides great data for school districts to use to improve the education of the children that they serve.  Different schools can zero in on the data that they want out of their own row, and easily compare that data to other schools to make quick and necessary changes.
