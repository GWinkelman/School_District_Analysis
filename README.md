# School_District_Analysis
### Using pandas, python, anaconda

## Purpose/Overview
This analysis was done for a school board that noticed some academic dishonesty from one of the schools in the initial report. The scores needed to be replaced to make the data more accurate, which can be seen below throughout the analysis.  

### Results
- Overall, it helps that the school district data is fixed now with the NaN function, which can be seen in the image below.  This doesn't cause a lot of change overall, however, since the data frame is looking at all schools, scores, and spending parameters.  The falsified data at Thomas High School caused their overall scores to slightly decrease, which just provides the school district with the most accurate data.  

- The school summary is affected much more, however, especially when diving into the statistics at Thomas High School. This correction shows that the averages and scores decreased after the fix in data.  This is important for staff to know what needs to be changed and where they sit in comparison to other schools.  

- After updating the school district analysis, there were a lot of different changes that could be seen in terms of grades and scores by certain types of sorting data. These can be seen in the categories below.
